# Requirements<sup><i>*</i></sup>

Library for Android to evaluate requirements chain. For example: network connection, permissions (API 23), system services (location, bluetooth, ...), etc in one uninterrupted action.

```gradle
implementation 'ru.noties:requirements:2.0.0'
```


## Overview

If a user action requires multiple conditions to be met (for example network connectivity, In order to react to a user action we must make sure that all requirements are satisfied for this action to proceed. Sometimes it's just _network connection_. Sometimes it's _location services_ and, on devices starting Marshmallow, the _location permission_. The list goes forth. So does the code in an Activity or a Fragment.

The aim of this library is to detach requirements' resolution process from the code and give flexibility to add/remove requirements on-the-go.

```java
final Requirement requirement = RequirementBuilder.create(EventDispatcher.create(this), eventSource)
        .add(new NetworkCase())
        .addIf(BuildUtils.isAtLeast(Build.VERSION_CODES.M), new LocationPermissionCase())
        .add(new LocationServicesCase())
        .build();
```

The pivot point of this library is the `RequirementCase`. It encapsulates one single case that must be met before an action can go further. It will receive `onActivityResult` and `onRequestPermissionsResult` events and can react to them if needed. In general: `RequirementCase` is state-less container that validates if requirement case is met and, if not, **starts resolution**.

There are 2 API methods in `RequirementCase` that must be implemented:
* `boolean meetsRequirement()`
* `void startResolution()`

For example in case of network connection one might do this:
```java
@Override
public boolean meetsRequirement() {
    final ConnectivityManager manager
            = (ConnectivityManager) appContext().getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);
    final NetworkInfo info = manager != null
            ? manager.getActiveNetworkInfo()
            : null;
    return info != null && info.isConnected();
}
```

If `meetRequirement` returns `false`, then `startResolution` will be called

```java
@Override
public void startResolution() {
    new AlertDialog.Builder(activity())
            // configuration of a dialog
            .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, (dialog, which) -> {
                    startActivityForResult(
                            new Intent(Settings.ACTION_WIRELESS_SETTINGS),
                            requestCode
                    );
            })
            .show();
}
```

```java
@Override
public boolean onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (this.requestCode == requestCode) {
        deliverResult(meetsRequirement());
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Event dispatcher

In order to decouple a `RequirementCase` from `Activity` `EventDispatcher` type was introduced. It is used to dispatch these events:

* startActivityForResult
* requestPermission
* checkSelfPermission
* shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale

Library provides 2 implementations:

* `EventDispatcherActivity` - `EventDispatcher.create(Activity)`
* `EventDispatcherFragment` - `EventDispatcher.create(Fragment)`

### Event source

In order for `RequirementCase` to react to Activity events, `EventSource` must be used. Obtain an instance of it by calling: `EventSource.create()`. Then redirect `onActivityResult` and `onRequestPermissionsResult` to it. Each method returns a boolean indicating if event was consumed.

```java

private final EventSource eventSource = EventSource.create();

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (!eventSource.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    }
}

@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
    if (!eventSource.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    }
}
```

>Please note that if an `EventDispatcher` is established via `Fragment` (thus dispatching events via Fragment methods), EventSource must also be intialized inside _that_ fragment (otherwise you won't receive any events).

### Validation

It's a good thing to start validation process in reaction to some action (button click, etc).

```java
requirement.validate(new Requirement.Listener() {
    @Override
    public void onRequirementSuccess() {
        // can proceed now
    }

    @Override
    public void onRequirementFailure(@Nullable Payload payload) {
        // cannot
    }
});
```

If requirements must be validated during some lifecycle event (onStart, etc), one can use `requirement.isInProgress()` method call to check if requirement is currently in progress.

There is also a synchronous method `isValid()` that returns `true|false` and does **not** start resolution.

### Cancellation

Requirement resolution can be cancelled by:
* `RequirementCase` by calling `deliverResult(boolean)` and `deliverResult(boolean, Payload)`
* calling `Requirement#cancel()` and `Requirement#cancel(Payload)`

### Cancellation payload

In order to react and take actions when requirement resolution was cancelled a simple type `Payload` was introduced. It's a `interface` with no methods defined to ensure type safety. It can contain data to identify specific cancellation case, which will be delivered to validation listener.


### Dialogs in resolution

It's aboslutely crucial that after `startResolution` is called `RequirementCase` must deliver success or cancellation event (it can be postponed for example until `onActivityResult` or `onRequestPermissionsResult` is delivered). Otherwise the requirements chain will break.

In case of showing a dialog in `startResolution`, it's advisable to track the dismiss state of a dialog. Library provides utility class `Flag` that can help keep track of dialog state:

```java

final Flag flag = Flag.create();

new AlertDialog.Builder(activity())
        .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {

				// mark as success
                flag.mark();

                // for example, start activity for result
            }
        })
        .setNegativeButton(android.R.string.cancel, null)
        .setOnDismissListener(new DialogInterface.OnDismissListener() {
            @Override
            public void onDismiss(DialogInterface dialog) {
                if (!flag.isSet()) {
                    deliverResult(false);
                }
            }
        })
        .show();
```

### Activity lifecycle

Internally `Requirement` listens for supplied activity lifecycle events and disposes itself when attached Activity went through `onDestroy`. If Activity was destroyed whilst requirement resolution process is still in progress that process will be lost.

### Multiple listeners

Please note that if a `Requirement#validate` is called and `Requirement#isInProgress` is true, supplied listener won't trigger the whole validation process again but instead will subscribe for the final result (with other listeners).

### Request code

Sometimes our creative abilities give us a hard time and we sit hours thinking of ideal request code:

```java
private static final int LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE = 72;
```

It's great time and I won't trade it for anything. Still, if you wish, there is an utility class to do this amazing job for you:

```java
RequestCode.createRequestCode(String);
RequestCode.createRequestCode(Class<?>);
```

### Permissions

To deal with Android runtime permissions (introduced on devices starting API 23), there is a base class to help with them - `PermissionCase`. It requires only one method to be implemented: `void showPermissionRationale`.

```java
public class LocationPermissionCase extends PermissionCase {

    public LocationPermissionCase() {
        super(Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION);
    }

    @Override
    protected void showPermissionRationale() {

        final Flag flag = Flag.create();

        new AlertDialog.Builder(activity())
                .setTitle(R.string.case_location_permission_title)
                .setMessage(R.string.case_location_permission_rationale_message)
                .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                        flag.mark();
                        requestPermission();
                    }
                })
                .setNegativeButton(android.R.string.cancel, null)
                .setOnDismissListener(new DialogInterface.OnDismissListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onDismiss(DialogInterface dialog) {
                        if (!flag.isSet()) {
                            deliverResult(false);
                        }
                    }
                })
                .show();
    }
}
```

If it's required to check if user selected `never` on permission request dialog, there is also a way to deal with it (by default it delivers cancellation result):

```java
@Override
protected void showExplanationOnNever() {

    final Flag flag = Flag.create();

    new AlertDialog.Builder(activity())
            .setTitle(R.string.case_location_permission_title)
            .setMessage(R.string.case_location_permission_never_message)
            .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                @Override
                public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                    flag.mark();
                    navigateToSettingsScreen();
                }
            })
            .setNegativeButton(android.R.string.cancel, null)
            .setOnDismissListener(new DialogInterface.OnDismissListener() {
                @Override
                public void onDismiss(DialogInterface dialog) {
                    if (!flag.isSet()) {
                        deliverResult(false);
                    }
                }
            })
            .show();
}
```

Aside from that `PermissionCase` offers these helper methods:
* `void requestPermission()`
* `void navigateToSettingsScreen()` - useful when implementing permission logic on user selected `never`
